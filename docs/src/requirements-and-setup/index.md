# ‚ùñ Requirements

Tilde is meant to be very hands off, but there are still a few things you'll need to do manually to set it up for success.

It's not very complicated, but the instructions are written under the assumption that you're at least slightly comfortable with the unix commandline.

We'll go over configuring the requirements for the following things in this section:

1. [Server configuration and SSH](./server-configuration-and-ssh.md)
2. [Port Forwarding](./port-forwarding.md)
3. [Dynamic DNS](./dynamic-dns.md)
4. [Environment Variables](./environment-variables.md)
