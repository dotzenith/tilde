# ‚ùñ Requirements

Tilde is meant to be very hands off, but there's still a few things you'll need to do manually to set it up for success.

It's not very complicated, but the instructions are written under the assumption that you're at least a little bit
familiar with unix commandline.

We'll go over configuring the requirements for the following things in this section:

1. [Server configuration and SSH](./server-configuration-and-ssh.md)
2. [Port Forwarding](./port-forwarding.md)
3. [Dynamic DNS](./dynamic-dns.md)
4. [Environment Variables](./environment-variables.md)
