# ❖ Service Configuration

You have your shiny new server! Let's talk a little about the services running on this server.
There is not much to say about most of these, just things to keep in mind and some tips!

The services running are as follows:

  - [Nginx Proxy Manager](./nginx.md)
  - [Wireguard](,/wireguard.md)
  - [Grafana](./grafana.md)
  - [Jellyfin](,/jellyfin.md)
  - [Nextcloud](./nextcloud.md)
> [!NOTE]
> There are other services running, but they are auxiliary to the ones listed above. Run `docker ps` to see them.
